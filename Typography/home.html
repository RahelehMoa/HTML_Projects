       <h2>Fractional quantum Hall effect at zero magnetic field observed in an unexpected material</h2>
       <p>The fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect occurs when the Hall resistance in a material is <span>quantized to fractional multiples of the fundamental unit h/e2 at zero magnetic field.</span> Observing the effect in a system consisting of a combination of five-layer graphene and hexagonal boron nitride enriches the family of topological matter phases, and opens up new opportunities in quantum computation.</p>
       <p>The Department of Biomedical Sciences (<a href="https://www.unil.ch/dsb/home.html">DBS</a>) is the main center for research activities in metabolic, 
        cardiovascular and renal diseases, regenerative medicine and aging, and is a privileged site of interaction 
        with the Clinical Services of the University Hospital (<a href="https://www.chuv.ch/fr/chuv-home/">CHUV</a>). <br>
        The department includes more than 100 scientists that take advantage of variety of research models to study the biological mechanisms governing the function of the human body and that are responsible for the appearance of human diseases. 
        In addition to its research mission, the DBS is playing a central role in teaching physiology 
        and basic pharmacology to biology and medical students.</p>
