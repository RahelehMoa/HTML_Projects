<p>The Zoo is open every day, except Dec. 25.</p>
<p>If you must leave the Zoo for any reason during your visit and plan to come back, you’ll need to have your hand stamped in the Visitor Center near the main Connecticut Avenue entrance or at the Harvard Street pedestrian entry tent at the bottom of the Zoo. If you intend to leave and return within the same day, you must reenter the Zoo before last admittance.</p>
</div>
<hr>

<h3>Do you have any facilities where I may nurse my child or pump?</h3>

This room is meant for single use only and includes two benches for seating, a small countertop, electrical outlets, and a locking door. This room does not have running water or diaper-changing facilities, but both can be found in nearby restrooms located behind the Conservation Pavilion next to Me and the Bee Playground.</p>

<h2 class="qzooh2-bricks">Cleaning and Safety</h2>
<h3>What COVID-19 precautions is the Zoo taking?</h3>
<p>The Smithsonian is implementing COVID-19 safety measures based on guidance from the CDC and local governments. See the Safety and Park Rules page for the latest guidance. If you feel sick, please do not visit the Zoo.</p>
<p>Bathrooms are open for you to wash your hands. We also encourage guests to bring their own hand sanitizer for personal use. Bathrooms and high-touch areas around the Zoo are cleaned frequently each day.</p>
<p>Several restaurants and food trucks are open. Tables and benches are spaced according to social distancing best practices.</p>

<div class="marginp">
<h3>Do I need to wear a face covering to visit?</h3>
<p>Masks are not required to visit Smithsonian museums or the Smithsonian's National Zoo.</p>
<p>While it will not be required, all visitors who feel more comfortable wearing a face mask during their visit are encouraged to do so.</p>
<p>The Smithsonian welcomes millions of visitors each year. We encourage visitors to maintain a safe social distance of six feet or more between households and groups when possible, but our museums get crowded, especially during peak visitation times. Visitors who wish to avoid crowds are encouraged to plan their visit during weekdays.</p>

<div class="marginp">
<h3>What are you doing to keep the animals safe?</h3>
<p>Animal care staff wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during their shifts to keep themselves and the animals safe, including any time they are working directly with animals, their food, or anything else an animal may come in contact with. We have also installed barriers throughout the Zoo to prevent visitors from coming within 6 feet of animals susceptible to the virus.</p>
